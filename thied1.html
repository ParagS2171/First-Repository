    <h1 style="text-align: center;">OOP Concepts</h1>
    <P>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts! They're the fundamental building blocks for structuring software in a
        way that mirrors the real world. Think of it as organizing your code around "objects" that have both data and
        behavior.</P>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Encapsulation: Imagine wrapping data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data
                into a single unit, like a capsule. This bundling protects the data from direct external modification
                and controls access through the object's methods. It promotes data integrity and helps prevent
                unintended side effects.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Abstraction: This involves hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential
                information to the user. Think of a TV remote â€“ you interact with buttons for volume and channels
                without needing to know the intricate electronics inside. Abstraction simplifies the user's interaction
                with an object.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Inheritance: This is like a parent-child relationship. A new class (the child or derived class) can
                inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (the parent or base class). This promotes code
                reusability. For example, a Car class might inherit general properties from a Vehicle class, like speed
                and start_engine(), and then have its own specific properties like number_of_doors.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Polymorphism: This literally means "many forms." In OOP, it allows objects of different classes to
                respond to the same method call in their own specific way. Consider a draw() method. A Circle object
                would draw a circle, while a Square object would draw a square, even though you're calling the same
                draw() method on both. This adds flexibility and extensibility to your code
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
