    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Type Checking at Runtime: The primary purpose of instanceof is to determine if an object belongs to a
                specific class or if it implements a particular interface during the execution of your program. This is
                different from compile-time type checking, where the compiler verifies type compatibility based on
                declarations.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Conditional Logic Based on Type: You often use instanceof within conditional statements (if, else if) to
                perform different actions based on the object's type.

                For example, imagine you have a collection of different Shape objects (like Circle, Square, Triangle),
                and you want to calculate the area. The way you calculate the area will be different for each shape. You
                could use instanceof to determine the actual type of each Shape object and then call the appropriate
                area calculation method:

                Java

                if (shape instanceof Circle) {
                Circle circle = (Circle) shape; // Need to cast to access Circle-specific methods
                double area = circle.calculateArea();
                System.out.println("Circle Area: " + area);
                } else if (shape instanceof Square) {
                Square square = (Square) shape; // Need to cast
                double area = square.calculateArea();
                System.out.println("Square Area: " + area);
                } // ... and so on for other shapes</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Safely Casting Objects: When you have a reference to an object of a superclass or an interface, and you
                need to access methods or properties specific to a subclass, you need to "cast" the object to that
                subclass type. However, if the object isn't actually an instance of that subclass, the cast will result
                in a ClassCastException at runtime, crashing your program. instanceof allows you to check the object's
                type before attempting the cast, making your code safer.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
